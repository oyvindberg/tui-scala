/// Production-supported render engine for embedding jatatui-react in a host app that owns its own
/// event loop and frame cadence. The companion to [ReactApp]: same render and dispatch semantics,
/// but you call them from your loop rather than handing the loop over.
///
/// Hold a single instance for the lifetime of your app (or per screen if you fully reset between
/// screens — see [#resetState]). Per frame:
///
/// 1. From inside `terminal.draw(frame -> { ... })`: call [#render]
/// 2. After `terminal.draw` returns: dispatch any input events via [#dispatchKey] / [#dispatchMouse],
///    cycle focus via [#tab] / [#shiftTab], check [#takeDirty] for the next iteration.
///
/// Example loop skeleton:
/// ```
/// Renderer r = new Renderer();
/// Element root = ...;
/// while (running) {
///   if (r.takeDirty()) terminal.draw(frame -> r.render(frame, root));
///   if (jni.poll(timeout)) {
///     Event ev = jni.read();
///     // host's own Tab / Esc / quit handling, then:
///     switch (ev) {
///       case Event.Key key when key.kind() == Press -> r.dispatchKey(toReactKey(key));
///       case Event.Mouse m -> r.dispatchMouse(toReactMouse(m));
///       case Event.Resize __ -> r.requestRerender();
///       default -> {}
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [ReactApp] is a thin wrapper around Renderer that adds the opinionated bindings: Tab cycles
/// focus, BackTab cycles backward, Ctrl-C and unhandled-Esc quit, mouse capture is enabled for
/// the duration of the loop, poll timeout 100ms. If any of those don't fit your host, use
/// [Renderer] directly.
///
/// **Threading.** [#requestRerender] is threadsafe — call it from background timers / executors
/// (this is what [jatatui.components.toast.ToastsProvider] does for auto-dismiss). [#render] and
/// the dispatch methods MUST run on a single thread (the loop thread); they mutate the hook /
/// event / focus state.
