/// A `StatefulWidget` is a widget that can take advantage of some local state to remember things
/// between two draw calls.
///
/// Most widgets can be drawn directly based on the input parameters. However, some features may
/// require some kind of associated state to be implemented.
///
/// For example, the [`List`] widget can highlight the item currently selected. This can be
/// translated in an offset, which is the number of elements to skip in order to have the selected
/// item within the viewport currently allocated to this widget. The widget can therefore only
/// provide the following behavior: whenever the selected item is out of the viewport scroll to a
/// predefined position (making the selected item the last viewable item or the one in the middle
/// for example). Nonetheless, if the widget has access to the last computed offset then it can
/// implement a natural scrolling experience where the last offset is reused until the selected
/// item is out of the viewport.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use std::io;
/// # use tui::Terminal;
/// # use tui::backend::{Backend, TestBackend};
/// # use tui::widgets::{Widget, List, ListItem, ListState};
///
/// // Let's say we have some events to display.
/// struct Events {
///     // `items` is the state managed by your application.
///     items: Vec<String>,
///     // `state` is the state that can be modified by the UI. It stores the index of the selected
///     // item as well as the offset computed during the previous draw call (used to implement
///     // natural scrolling).
///     state: ListState
/// }
///
/// impl Events {
///     fn new(items: Vec<String>) -> Events {
///         Events {
///             items,
///             state: ListState::default(),
///         }
///     }
///
///     pub fn set_items(&mut self, items: Vec<String>) {
///         self.items = items;
///         // We reset the state as the associated items have changed. This effectively reset
///         // the selection as well as the stored offset.
///         self.state = ListState::default();
///     }
///
///     // Select the next item. This will not be reflected until the widget is drawn in the
///     // `Terminal::draw` callback using `Frame::render_stateful_widget`.
///     pub fn next(&mut self) {
///         let i = match self.state.selected() {
///             Some(i) => {
///                 if i >= self.items.len() - 1 {
///                     0
///                 } else {
///                     i + 1
///                 }
///             }
///             None => 0,
///         };

///                 }

///             None => 0,
///         };
///         self.state.select(Some(i));
///     }
///
///     // Unselect the currently selected item if any. The implementation of `ListState` makes
///     // sure that the stored offset is also reset.
